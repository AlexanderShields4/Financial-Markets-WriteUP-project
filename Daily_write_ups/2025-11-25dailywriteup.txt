PM Market Brief by Gemini

Date: November 25, 2025

1. Market Summary

Major Indices Performance
U.S. equities surged on Tuesday, continuing the strong start to the holiday-shortened week. Investor sentiment was decidedly bullish, fueled by persistent strength in the technology sector and growing expectations of a potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones led the gains with a significant rally of over 1.3%, while the small-cap focused Russell 2000 outperformed, climbing 2.00%, signaling broad market participation and a strong risk-on appetite. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ also posted solid gains of 1.03% and 0.98%, respectively. Headlines from the past day highlighted Alphabet's role in kicking off the week's rally, and today's session saw that momentum carry through to the broader market.

VIX and Market Sentiment
Reflecting the confident mood in equities, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) plummeted, closing at 18.56 after opening at 20.55. This sharp decline below the 20 level indicates a significant easing of investor anxiety and suggests traders are not pricing in major near-term market turbulence. The move aligns perfectly with the strong rally across all major indices.

2. Fixed Income & Macro

Treasury Spreads Analysis
In the bond market, the latest available data from Monday showed a continued steepening of the key 10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury yield spread, which widened to +58 basis points. A steepening yield curve is often interpreted as a positive economic signal, suggesting bond market participants are anticipating stronger growth or inflation in the future. This move away from inversion provides a supportive backdrop for risk assets. The 10-Year minus 3-Month spread, another closely watched indicator, narrowed slightly to +13 basis points, a level that still warrants monitoring.

Dollar Index Movements
The US Dollar Index (DXY) weakened today, falling from 100.21 to close at 99.81. The decline in the dollar contributed to the risk-on environment, as a softer greenback can be beneficial for profits of U.S. multinational corporations. This movement also reflects the market pricing in higher odds of a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve.

3. Commodities & Energy

Oil Markets (WTI/Brent)
Energy markets diverged from the bullish sentiment seen in equities. WTI Crude prices fell, opening at $58.89 and closing lower at $58.10 per barrel. Similarly, the international benchmark, Brent Crude, saw its price decline from an open of $62.42 to a close of $61.93. The drop in oil prices, despite a weaker dollar, may point to underlying concerns about global demand or specific supply-side dynamics.

Gold Price Action
Gold moved higher, capitalizing on the weaker U.S. dollar. The precious metal opened at $4133.50 and climbed to close at $4163.60 per ounce. The move suggests that despite the strong performance in equities, some investors continue to seek out gold as a hedge against potential long-term inflation or geopolitical uncertainty.

4. Economic Data

Today's Releases
There were no major economic data releases on the calendar for today, which kept the market's focus squarely on corporate news, tech sector momentum, and Federal Reserve policy expectations.

Forward Calendar
Looking ahead, trading volumes are expected to decline as the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday approaches. The market will be watching for any jobless claims data later this week, but the primary focus will remain on parsing Fed official commentary for clues regarding the path of monetary policy into year-end and 2026.

5. Key Takeaways & Outlook

Today was a classic risk-on session defined by a powerful equity rally, a sharp drop in volatility, and a weaker U.S. dollar. The rally was broad-based, with small-caps showing notable strength, suggesting investors are gaining confidence in the economic outlook. This optimism appears rooted in the belief that the Federal Reserve may be poised to cut interest rates sooner rather than later.

The steepening of the 10-2 yield curve supports this positive narrative. However, the decline in oil prices presents a slight contradiction, suggesting that not all asset classes are signaling unbridled economic optimism. The rise in gold alongside stocks also points to a complex environment where some investors are hedging their bets.

The outlook for the remainder of the short week is constructive, though prone to lower liquidity. The market's momentum is clearly positive, but investors will be sensitive to any data or headlines that might challenge the prevailing Fed rate cut narrative.

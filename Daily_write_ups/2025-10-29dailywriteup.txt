# **PM Market Brief by Gemini**
### **OCTOBER 29, 2025**

***

A risk-off sentiment permeated markets on Wednesday, as investors grappled with a surging U.S. dollar and a spike in volatility. Major equity indices retreated across the board, led by small caps, while a mixed performance among mega-cap technology stocks failed to lift the broader market. The day was characterized by a flight to the perceived safety of the dollar, suggesting growing investor caution despite a relatively quiet day for economic data.

### **1. Market Summary**

#### **Major Indices Performance**
Equities finished the day firmly in the red, erasing modest opening gains. The **S&P 500** fell by 0.45%, while the **Dow Jones Industrial Average** shed 0.29%. The tech-heavy **NASDAQ Composite** declined 0.41%. Small-cap stocks, as measured by the **Russell 2000**, underperformed their large-cap peers, dropping 0.64% in a classic sign of reduced risk appetite. The selling pressure indicates that while corporate earnings have been a focus, broader macroeconomic concerns are weighing on investor confidence.

#### **VIX and Market Sentiment**
Market anxiety saw a significant uptick today. The CBOE Volatility Index (**VIX**), often called the market's "fear gauge," surged nearly 6% to close at **17.29**. This jump from the low 16s indicates a notable increase in demand for portfolio protection and reflects the uncertain sentiment that drove equities lower.

### **2. Fixed Income & Macro**

#### **Treasury Spreads Analysis**
While today's final figures are still settling, the **10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury yield spread** has remained in solidly positive territory, hovering around +0.53% in recent sessions. This persistently positive, or "steep," yield curve is historically a signal of economic expansion and is not currently flashing recessionary warnings. However, the market's focus today was less on the long-term economic picture painted by the curve and more on short-term risk dynamics.

#### **Dollar Index Movements**
The most significant macro development was the powerful rally in the **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**. The index surged 0.51% to close at **99.24**. This flight to the dollar is a classic risk-off signal, suggesting that global investors are seeking safety amidst market uncertainty. A stronger dollar can also act as a headwind for U.S. multinational corporate profits and weigh on commodity prices.

### **3. Commodities & Energy**

#### **Oil Markets (WTI/Brent)**
Crude oil prices bucked the broader risk-off trend, posting modest gains. **WTI Crude** settled at **$60.52** a barrel, while **Brent Crude** closed at **$64.32**. The strength appears linked to supply-side concerns, with news reports highlighting potential disruptions from refinery outages and ongoing geopolitical tensions.

#### **Gold Price Action**
**Gold** showed remarkable resilience in the face of a surging dollar, closing nearly flat at **$3,966.30** per ounce. Typically, a stronger greenback creates significant headwinds for the dollar-denominated metal. The fact that gold held its ground suggests that underlying safe-haven demand is providing a strong counterbalance to the currency pressure.

### **4. Economic Data**

#### **Today's Releases**
There were no major economic data releases on the calendar for Wednesday, leaving investors to focus on corporate earnings reports and broader market sentiment. The U.S. money supply was reported to have moved to a high of $22.2 trillion, a data point that will be monitored by those watching inflationary pressures.

#### **Forward Calendar**
Looking ahead, the market's attention will turn to tomorrow's preliminary Q3 GDP figures and the weekly jobless claims report. These releases will provide a critical update on the health of the U.S. economy and could influence expectations for the Federal Reserve's next policy move.

### **5. Key Takeaways & Outlook**

Todayâ€™s session was a clear demonstration of investor caution. The key takeaways are:
1.  **A Decisive Risk-Off Day:** The combination of falling stocks (especially small caps), a rising VIX, and a rallying U.S. dollar points to a clear reduction in investor risk appetite.
2.  **King Dollar's Return:** The dollar's strength was the day's dominant theme. Its continued ascent could pose a challenge for risk assets in the near term.
3.  **Divergent Mega-Caps:** The Magnificent 7 saw a mixed performance. **Google (GOOGL)** was a notable outperformer, rallying 1.87%. However, weakness in **Microsoft (MSFT)**, **Amazon (AMZN)**, and **Meta (META)** dragged on the major indices, showing that even the market leaders are not immune to sentiment shifts. This occurred even as headlines noted Microsoft had recently passed a $4 trillion market capitalization.
4.  **Resilient Commodities:** Both oil and gold held up well, suggesting their price action is being driven by unique supply/demand and safe-haven factors that are currently insulating them from the broader market downturn.

**Outlook:** The market appears to be in a consolidation phase, balancing a decent earnings season against macroeconomic headwinds signaled by the strong dollar. The spike in the VIX suggests that further volatility may be ahead. Tomorrow's GDP data will be a crucial test of whether the economy's underlying strength is sufficient to overcome the market's current cautious stance.

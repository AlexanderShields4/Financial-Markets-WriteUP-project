# **PM Market Brief by Gemini**

**October 29, 2025**

Good afternoon. Today’s session was characterized by a palpable sense of anticipation as markets adopted a wait-and-see approach ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy decision. The major indices painted a mixed picture, with strength in industrials and small caps contrasting with a slight pullback in technology. The dominant narrative continues to revolve around artificial intelligence, with major players making significant capital commitments that underscore the sector's long-term importance. Meanwhile, gold made a significant technical and psychological breakthrough, soaring past the $4,000 level.

### **1. Market Summary**

**Major Indices Performance**
Equity markets showed notable divergence. The **Dow Jones Industrial Average** was the clear leader, closing up **+0.52%**, while the small-cap **Russell 2000** also posted a solid gain of **+0.73%**. This suggests a potential rotation into cyclicals and value-oriented names. In contrast, the tech-heavy **NASDAQ Composite** shed **-0.14%**, and the broad **S&P 500** finished nearly flat, down just **-0.05%**.

The **Magnificent 7** were mostly lower, reflecting the broader tech pause. **Google (GOOGL)** was the standout performer, surging **+1.62%** on news of a partnership to revive a nuclear plant to power its future AI data centers. **Microsoft (MSFT)** and **Nvidia (NVDA)** saw modest pullbacks of **-1.04%** and **-1.10%** respectively, likely reflecting some profit-taking after recent gains and major news events, including a new Microsoft-OpenAI deal valuing OpenAI at $500 billion and Nvidia's strategic investment in Nokia.

**VIX and Market Sentiment**
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ticked slightly higher, closing at **16.58**. This level remains well below historical averages, indicating that while there is some caution ahead of the Fed, there is no widespread fear in the market. The muted VIX suggests investors are positioned for the FOMC announcement but are not expecting a major policy shock.

### **2. Fixed Income & Macro**

**Treasury Spreads Analysis**
The closely watched **10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury yield spread** has remained stable in positive territory, holding in a narrow range of 0.52% to 0.54% over the past week. A positive and stable yield curve is typically viewed as a healthy economic sign, suggesting that bond market participants are not pricing in an imminent recession. The market's focus now shifts entirely to the Fed's statement for any change in tone regarding inflation persistence and future rate trajectory, which will undoubtedly influence the entire curve.

**Dollar Index Movements**
The **US Dollar Index (DXY)** showed little conviction, drifting slightly lower to close at **98.69**. This minor weakness reflects trader positioning ahead of the FOMC. A more dovish-than-expected statement could pressure the dollar further, while any hawkish surprise would likely send the index higher.

### **3. Commodities & Energy**

**Oil Markets (WTI/Brent)**
Crude oil prices rebounded today, brushing aside recent concerns about a supply glut. **WTI Crude** settled at **$60.88** per barrel (+1.16%), while **Brent Crude** closed at **$64.58** (+1.08%). The gains came despite ongoing chatter about ample supply, suggesting that short-term demand signals or geopolitical factors provided support during the session.

**Gold Price Action**
The standout performer in the commodities space was **Gold**, which surged **+1.13%** to close decisively above the $4,000 mark at **$4012.20 per ounce**. This powerful move can be attributed to a confluence of factors: a slightly softer US dollar, safe-haven buying ahead of the central bank decision, and persistent demand for a hedge against long-term inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty.

### **4. Economic Data**

**Today's Releases**
Today's economic calendar was light on top-tier data, featuring releases such as the Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index and various state and local employment figures. These releases had minimal market impact as all eyes were fixed on the afternoon's primary event: the **FOMC Press Release**. The market's price action throughout the day was a direct reflection of positioning for this announcement.

**Forward Calendar**
Looking ahead, the market will spend tomorrow dissecting the nuance of the FOMC statement and Fed Chair's press conference. Beyond the Fed, traders will be looking toward the end of the week for any further inflation data and will begin positioning for the official **October Employment Report** (Non-Farm Payrolls), expected next week.

### **5. Key Takeaways & Outlook**

Today was a classic pre-Fed session, defined by indecision and sector rotation. The key takeaways are:
*   **A Divergent Market:** The strength in the Dow and Russell 2000 against weakness in the Nasdaq points to a market grappling with valuations in big tech and potentially seeking opportunities in other sectors.
*   **AI Arms Race Escalates:** The sheer scale of capital being deployed for AI infrastructure—highlighted by deals from Google, Microsoft, Blackstone, and Nvidia—confirms that this secular trend remains the market's primary driver, creating distinct winners and losers.
*   **Gold's Golden Moment:** The breach of $4,000 is a significant psychological and technical event. It signals that investors are increasingly seeking portfolio protection, a trend that could accelerate if the Fed signals a more tolerant stance on inflation.
*   **All Eyes on the Fed:** The market is poised for the Fed's updated outlook. The central bank's language on economic growth, the labor market, and its inflation forecast will set the tone for the remainder of the year. Any deviation from the expected "hold steady" message will likely introduce significant volatility.
